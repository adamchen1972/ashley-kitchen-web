# Ashley Kitchen — Website Structure & Architecture

> Taiwan exclusive distributor of plyē engineered flooring and Nalexible flexible stone/fiberboard.

---

## Site Overview

A static multi-page website (no framework, no build step). All pages share:
- **`script.js`** — single shared JS file handling EN/ZH bilingual translation via a `T` dictionary and `setLang()` function (1,691 lines)
- **`favicon.svg`** — brand icon
- **Google Fonts** — Poppins, Cormorant Garamond, DM Sans, Noto Serif/Sans TC

Primary cross-page planning document:

- [SITE_PAGE_PLAN.md](/Users/adamchen/Desktop/web_dev/SITE_PAGE_PLAN.md)
- [SITE_RESTRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md](/Users/adamchen/Desktop/web_dev/SITE_RESTRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md)

## Important Documents

### Ashley Kitchen Stone Systems Brochure (canonical — stored at `docs/brochure/`)

The canonical stone brochure is a 15-page A4-portrait English PDF that accompanies the website. Current approved version:

- **Current file (print-ready):** `docs/brochure/ashley-kitchen-stone-systems-overview-final-facade-v8-p9-balance-p14-canonical.pdf` (2026-04-18 print revision of v5; supersedes internal v6/v7)
- **Previous files (kept for reference):**
  - `docs/brochure/ashley-kitchen-stone-systems-overview-final-facade-v7-p9-3layer-p14-ppt-patterns.pdf` (v7 — internal review iteration, not print-ready; had residual Square annotations and tile pills overlaid on top of wrong base images)
  - `docs/brochure/ashley-kitchen-stone-systems-overview-final-facade-v5-single-qr-light-cover.pdf` (v5 — pre-revision baseline)
- **Pages:** 15 (cover, Why-Stone-Systems, Family Map, Flexible Stone, LumiSlate, light-behaviour grid, Exterior, Curved Surfaces, technical overview, back cover with single QR to `www.ashleykitchen.co`)
- **Status:** v8 print-ready. All pages A4 (595×842 pt), zero annotations, all p14 tiles ≥ 520 DPI, new p9 EN diagram at 1376 DPI — this is the version all future brochure edits should derive from
- **Review renders:** `docs/brochure/v8-review/p9-before-v7-after-v8.png`, `docs/brochure/v8-review/p14-before-v7-after-v8.png` (side-by-side comparisons); final-only renders in the same folder as `p9-v8-final.png` / `p14-v8-final.png`
- **Source material (for future edits):**
  - `docs/brochure/sources/lumislate-source-zh.pptx` — the original Chinese Nalexible LumiSlate PPT (used for page 9's 3-layer diagram)
  - `docs/brochure/sources/nalexible-product-materials-zh.pptx` — the full Nalexible product-material PPT (used for the canonical per-SKU slab photography; p16 = Sanjayani White / 7013, p17 = Copper New / 7014)

Keep the website page copy and visual direction consistent with this brochure (especially LumiSlate section, the family-direction language, and the 4-state light-behaviour grid on page 6). The A/B hero test on `index.html`, the `catalog-stone.html` series grid, and the LumiSlate card imagery were all built to mirror this brochure.

**Provenance note.** On 2026-04-17 the repo went through a `temp-before-history-cleanup` rewrite, after which 13 iterations of the brochure (draft, draft-print-v2/v4/v5/v6, facade-preview, final-facade-v2/v3/v4/v5, final-enhanced-v1/v2/v3) existed only as dangling git objects. On 2026-04-18 the v5 single-qr-light-cover version was re-extracted from the dangling objects and restored to `docs/brochure/`. If you need a different iteration for comparison, they are still recoverable via `git fsck --lost-found --no-reflogs` until the next `git gc --prune=now`.

**Modifications applied in v8 (2026-04-18, print-ready; supersedes internal v6/v7):**

Build pipeline: `fitz.open(v5) → delete_annot(all) → page.replace_image(xref) → page.insert_image(...) → save(garbage=4, deflate=True, clean=True)`. This is true object replacement (not overlay), so 7013/7014 tile captions (PDF text layer) stay untouched and the new slab bitmaps inherit the original clipping/bbox metadata.

- **Page 14 (swatch grid — xref-level replacement)** — BOTH highlighted tiles replaced in place at the PDF-object level (no overlay "pill" this time):
  - `page.replace_image(xref=151, filename=tile_7013_new.jpg)` — 7013 Sanjayani White ← PPT slide 16 (霞白 / Sanjayani White, spec 5013 / 6013 / 6113). Source rotated 90° CW, center-cropped to 674×1409 portrait (aspect 1:2.086 matching neighbor tiles), UnsharpMask(r=1.2, 35%, thr=2) + Contrast×1.04 + gentle blend toward neighbor-row mean RGB(152,161,164)/std(23). Tile rect unchanged at `(251.25, 328.5, 344.25, 522.0)`, ~523 DPI.
  - `page.replace_image(xref=153, filename=tile_7014_new.jpg)` — 7014 Copper New ← PPT slide 17 (朝红 / Copper New, spec 5014 / 6014 / 6114). Same pipeline; tile rect unchanged at `(351.0, 331.5, 444.0, 519.0)`, ~522 DPI.
- **Page 9 (technical card — "How the system is built")** — three coordinated changes:
  1. `delete_annot` on both pages: removes the red Square review markers (p9 at `(62.7, 673.0, 150.1, 758.1)`, p14 at `(345.4, 387.0, 450.0, 479.2)`).
  2. `page.replace_image(xref=33, pixmap=cream 8×8)` + an opaque cream `draw_rect(51.5, 680.0, 155.0, 755.0)` in card fill `#FAF8F3 (0.9843, 0.9725, 0.9529)` — this neutralises both the old Chinese 3-layer photo pill (xref=33 at `(50.25, 682.5, 150.75, 749.25)`) and the small decorative placeholder pill drawn at `(90.75, 681.75, 110.25, 750.0)`. Rect stops at x=155 so the three orange bullet indicators (at x=157.5–161.25) stay fully visible.
  3. `page.insert_image(rect=(60.8, 664.4, 155.0, 727.2), filename=lumislate_3layer_en_cream.png, keep_proportion=True)` — 3-layer diagram composite (1800×1200, ~1376 DPI). Labels translated from 天然石材 / 粘合剂 / 透明树脂 to **Natural Stone / Adhesive Layer / Transparent Resin**. Width stops at x=155 (before arrow column); vertical center y≈695.8 aligned with bullets mid (y=671–720). Strictly inside card (x=51.0–544.5, y=618.75–770.25), with 4.8 pt above subtitle (y=661.2) and 2.5 pt below last bullet (y=720.3), no overflow.

**Print-ready verification (v8):**
- 15 pages, all A4 595×842 pt
- 0 annotations document-wide
- All p14 swatch tiles ≥ 520 DPI (above 300 DPI print minimum)
- New p9 EN diagram at 1376 DPI
- Saved with `garbage=4, deflate=True, clean=True` (PDF 1.4, 31.1 MB)
- Row 3 tile brightness confirmed consistent: 7011 Ocean Green (132) → 7012 Multi Pink (160) → 7013 Sanjayani White (172) → 7014 Copper New (179) → 7015 Silver Grey (144) — 7013/7014 fall within the light-tile range of the row

If a future revision is needed, start from the v8 file, not v5 or v7. v5 and v7 are retained for diffing only.

## Collaboration Notes

This workspace may be edited by multiple assistants, including Codex and Claude.ai.

To reduce conflicts and unnecessary rework:

- check `SITE_PAGE_PLAN.md` before making major page-level design changes
- check `SITE_RESTRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md` when making homepage / catalog / applications / projects / about changes
- keep page roles distinct instead of re-solving structure in every file separately
- prefer additive planning notes before large cross-page redesign moves
- update this README or the relevant page plan after meaningful structural decisions

## Image Asset Management Principles (established 2026-04-05)

These principles apply to all product image folders across the site. Follow them for every product line.

### 1. Two-Layer Asset Architecture

Every product's image folder should be organised into two layers:

```
images/{product}/
├── master/        ← Official HQ source files (archive — never referenced in HTML)
└── {web files}    ← Web-optimised files (these are what HTML src= points to)
```

- `master/` is the source-of-truth archive. It holds original brand-supplied or highest-quality images.
- Web files are generated from master, optimised for browser delivery.
- HTML always references web-layer files only — never anything inside `master/`.

### 2. Before Any Replacement — Visual Confirmation Required

**Never replace a web file with a new image based on filename or color-code matching alone.**

Before replacing any image:
1. Build a side-by-side visual comparison (or view both images)
2. Confirm the two images show the **same scene / same subject**
3. Only after visual confirmation: overwrite the web file with the higher-quality version
4. The original is only deleted after the replacement is confirmed working

Reason: same product code ≠ same photo. A swatch tile and a lifestyle room shot may share the same color code but are completely different images.

### 3. Web Optimisation Spec

When generating web files from master:

| Use case | Max dimension | JPEG quality | Target size |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Swatch / grid tile | 800px longest side | Q85 | 60–130KB |
| Full-width lifestyle / hero | 1440px longest side | Q85 | 150–300KB |
| Product detail / feature image | 1200px longest side | Q85 | 100–200KB |

Tool: Python Pillow, `Image.LANCZOS` resampling, `optimize=True`.

### 4. Naming Convention

```
{product}-swatch-{code}-{name}.jpg     ← web swatch tile
{product}-lifestyle-{description}.jpg  ← web lifestyle photo
{product}-hero-{description}.jpg       ← web hero image
master/{product}-hq-{code}-{n}.jpg     ← HQ product shot (master)
master/{product}-concept-{code}.jpg    ← HQ lifestyle/concept (master)
```

All filenames use lowercase ASCII only — no Chinese characters, no spaces.

### 5. README Update Rule

After any image addition, replacement, or reorganisation:
- Update the relevant section in this README
- Record: what changed, why, and the date
- This keeps ChatGPT, Claude, and any other collaborator in sync without needing to re-scan the folder

### 6. Deletion Rule

- **Never delete** a file until the replacement is visually confirmed and live
- When in doubt, move to `master/` or a `_deprecated/` subfolder rather than deleting
- Only delete when explicitly confirmed as safe by the project owner

## Mobile-First Working Rule

All future page design work should explicitly consider smartphone readers, not only desktop layouts.

This should be treated as a standing design and collaboration rule.

When designing or polishing pages, check mobile behavior for:

- hero height and first-screen clarity
- navigation simplicity and tap comfort
- card density and vertical rhythm
- text size, line length, and readability
- image cropping and focal points
- CTA visibility and tap targets
- long-page pacing and section compression

Current recommendation:

- optimize the website for mobile users before considering native iOS or Android apps
- treat the website as the primary mobile experience unless future product needs justify app development

## Cross-Page Image Rule

Design principle:

- avoid using the same primary image across multiple pages whenever reasonably possible

Allowed exceptions:

- the image is uniquely strong
- there is no better replacement
- the same image is serving clearly different roles

Default preference:

- homepage gets the strongest available images, especially the hero
- product pages get the second-best images after homepage needs are satisfied
- homepage uses brand-level imagery
- product pages use material-defining imagery
- applications uses typology imagery
- projects uses built proof imagery
- about should later use company / curation / process imagery rather than reusing product heroes

Practical priority order for photo selection:

1. homepage hero
2. homepage supporting lead images
3. product-page hero and core family images
4. applications and projects
5. lower sections and support imagery

### Design tokens (CSS variables, defined per-page)
```css
--red:   #E53935   /* Ashley Kitchen brand red */
--stone: #4A4A4A   /* dark grey text */
--sand:  #D9C5A1   /* warm accent / italic headings */
--dark:  #1A1714   /* near-black background */
--bg:    #F5F5F5   /* light background */
```

## Page Inventory

### 🏠 Homepage
| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `index.html` | **Active / Primary** | Ashley Kitchen-led homepage focused on brand positioning, DIY / project path split, material-family gateway, applications, projects, and next-step support |

### 📦 Product Pages
| File | Product | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `plye.html` | plyē Engineered Flooring (ORIGIN Series) | Primary plyē product page |
| `plye-b.html` | plyē Engineered Flooring | Alternative/draft version B |
| `plye-c.html` | plyē Engineered Flooring | Alternative/draft version C |
| `nalexible-stone.html` | Nalexible Flexible Stone Veneer | LumiSlate, 5 series, Taiwan exclusive |
| `nalexible-fiberboard.html` | Nalexible Natural Fiber Board | Quiet Door Series, acoustic panels |

Planning workspace:

- [assets/plye](/Users/adam/Desktop/web_dev/assets/plye) — plye brand files, planning docs, and copied source materials
- [assets/nalexible/stone/STONE_SERIES_REVIEW.md](/Users/adam/Desktop/web_dev/assets/nalexible/stone/STONE_SERIES_REVIEW.md) — reviewed 5 key stone-series decks and mapped them into website roles

### 🗂 Catalog Pages
| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `catalog.html` | Active | Full product catalog — Stone (5 series) + Fiberboard + plyē ORIGIN swatches. **Not linked in nav bar — needs a nav entry.** |
| `stone-catalog.html` | Legacy / Superseded | Earlier stone-only catalog; replaced by `catalog.html` |

### 🌐 Cross-Product Pages
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `applications.html` | Product × Application matrix (Residential / Commercial / Hospitality / Outdoor) across plyē, Stone, Fiberboard |
| `projects.html` | Case study cards — plyē, Stone, and Fiberboard installed projects |
| `contact.html` | Contact / sample request form |

---

## Navigation Structure

Homepage now follows a broader brand-gateway nav:

```
[Ashley Kitchen logo]  Products ▾  Catalog  Applications  Projects  About  Contact
                            └─ plyē Flooring
                            └─ Nalexible Stone
                            └─ Nalexible Fiberboard
```

Current planning logic for product-facing pages:

```
[Ashley Kitchen logo]  Catalog  Stone  Fiberboard  Applications  Projects  About  [Contact]
```

Reasoning:

- `Catalog` is the overview gateway
- direct product links should be early on product pages
- `Applications` explains fit before `Projects` supplies proof
- `About` supports trust later in the journey
- `Contact` stays last as the clearest action

**Language bar** (fixed, above nav): `ENGLISH | 繁體中文` — toggles `setLang('en'|'zh')`

> ⚠️ `catalog.html` has its own minimal nav (no dropdown, no "Products") — inconsistent with other pages.
> ⚠️ `catalog.html` is not linked from any nav bar — currently unreachable from the live site.

## Asset Structure (Current — flat root)

All assets currently live flat in `/web_dev/`. Planned reorganisation: see **Plan A** below.

### plyē Image Asset Architecture (updated 2026-04-05)

`images/plye/` now uses a two-layer asset system:

```
images/plye/
├── master/                   ← Official HQ brand images (archive — NOT referenced in HTML)
│   ├── plye-hq-{code}-1.jpg        Primary product shot (1200–1500px, 325–996KB)
│   ├── plye-hq-{code}-2.jpg        Secondary product shot
│   ├── plye-hq-{code}-1200.jpg     1200px high-res version (where available)
│   └── plye-concept-{code}.jpg     Official lifestyle / 形象概念圖
│
└── plye-swatch-{code}-{name}.jpg   ← Web-optimised swatch (800×800px, 69–125KB, JPEG Q85)
    plye-lifestyle-*.jpg            ← Web lifestyle photos (HTML-referenced)
    plye-hero-*.jpg                 ← Hero images (HTML-referenced)
    plye_dm_*.jpeg/png              ← DM feature icons (HTML-referenced)
```

**Working rule:**
- HTML always references files directly inside `images/plye/` — never `master/`
- `master/` is the source-of-truth archive; generate web files from here
- To upgrade any web image: re-export from `master/` at target size, overwrite web file, HTML untouched

**Swatch optimization spec (applied 2026-04-05):**
- Source: `master/plye-hq-{code}-1.jpg` (official brand zip, 1200–1500px)
- Output: 800×800px, JPEG quality 85, Pillow LANCZOS
- Result: 69–125KB per swatch (down from 162–384KB — 50–75% smaller, higher quality)

### Images by category

| Prefix / Pattern | Count | Content |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| `images/plye/plye-swatch-*.jpg` | 12 | Web-optimised colour swatches (800×800px, ~69–125KB each) |
| `images/plye/plye-lifestyle-*.jpg` | 18 | Lifestyle/interior photos used in HTML |
| `images/plye/plye-hero-*.jpg` | 1 | Hero image |
| `images/plye/plye_dm_*` | 9 | DM feature icons/photos |
| `images/plye/master/plye-hq-*` | 28 | HQ master product shots (archive) |
| `images/plye/master/plye-concept-*` | 13 | HQ lifestyle concept images (archive) |
| `nal-hero-*`, `nal-case-*`, `nal-com-*`, `nal-res-*`, `nal-hos-*`, `nal-out-*`, `nal-stone-*`, `nal-gal-*`, `nal-g-*`, `nal-tmp-*` | ~55 | Active stone lifestyle/application images used in HTML |
| `nal-case715-*`, `nal-prod715-*`, `nal-trans715-*` | ~170 | PDF-extracted stone images (from internal 715-page catalog PDF) — mostly unused in HTML |
| `fb-*.jpg` | 15 | Fiberboard door/interior/partition photos |
| `bro_*.jpg`, `tok_*.jpg` | ~70 | Raw PDF extracts (brochure + Tokyo exhibition book) — temporary, not in HTML |
| `app-*.jpg` | 8 | Old application matrix images (superseded, mostly unused) |
| `nal-trans-p5-*.jpeg/png`, `trans-p5-*.png` | 4 | LumiSlate translucency detail renders |

### Stone Image Asset Architecture (established 2026-04-06)

### plyē Public Positioning — export-facing website
Per plye.com.tw/collections/origin (NT$4,500 each):
1. Origin 微光沙橡 (Micro-light Sand Oak)
2. Origin 晨曦白橡 (Dawn White Oak)
3. Origin 暖杏橡木 (Warm Apricot Oak)
4. Origin 柔光灰橡 (Soft Gray Oak)
5. Origin 柔沙橡木 (Soft Sand Oak)
6. Origin 沈靜灰橡 (Deep Gray Oak)
7. Origin 溫潤棕橡 (Warm Brown Oak)
8. Origin 深邃黑橡 (Deep Black Oak)
9. Origin 煦日金橡 (Golden Oak)
10. Origin 經典原橡 (Classic Oak)

Current English-site positioning should favor:

- FSC-sourced birch plywood core messaging
- EU E1 low-formaldehyde compliance as the first public-facing compliance story
- patent four-direction click-lock installation
- quieter residential living and DIY-ready installation

Legacy source materials may still mention eucalyptus or SGS F1, but those should not drive the current English-facing public page without updated factory support.

## Translation System

`script.js` exports a `T` dictionary keyed by element `id`:
```js
const T = {
  'element-id': { en: 'English text', zh: '中文文字' },
  ...
}
```
`setLang(lang)` iterates all keys and sets `innerHTML` on matching DOM elements.
Each HTML page has element IDs matching T keys for its translatable content.

## UI Fixes

| Date | Page | Fix |
|------|------|-----|
| 2026-04-07 | `applications.html` | Application grid captions (`.mc-overlay`) changed from always-visible (`opacity:1`) to hidden at rest, revealed on hover (`opacity:0` → hover `opacity:1` with upward slide). Photos now fully visible by default. |
| 2026-04-07 | `nalexible-fiberboard.html` | `.proof-main-copy h3` had `max-width:11ch` causing the proof section title to wrap after every 1–2 words, making the page excessively long. Removed the max-width constraint; kept `line-height:1.14` for tighter heading rhythm. |
| 2026-04-07 | `nalexible-fiberboard.html` | All `<video>` elements now default to 50% volume on page load via `document.querySelectorAll("video").forEach(v => v.volume = 0.5)` added at end of script. |
| 2026-04-07 | `nalexible-fiberboard.html` | **Bug fix:** Duplicate `serve(el));</script></body></html>` fragment (lines 1171–1174) — leftover from a previous edit — removed. File now has a single valid closing sequence. |
| 2026-04-07 | `nalexible-stone.html` | All `<video>` elements now default to 50% volume on page load (same pattern as fiberboard). |
| 2026-04-07 | `plye.html` | Added `anti-mold` badge tag to Surface Protection card product-meta (same pill style as existing wear layer / easy maintenance / home-ready tags). |
| 2026-04-08 | `index.html` | Added `padding-bottom:80px` to `#technology` (Next Steps) section to create breathing room above the footer. |
| 2026-04-08 | `index.html` | Added `padding-bottom:64px` to `#products` section to create visible gap between product cards and Applications section. |
| 2026-04-08 | `plye.html` | Reduced `.section` padding desktop 116px→68px→**46px**, mobile 82px→52px→**34px**; hero bottom 54px→**32px**; `footer margin-top` 92px→48px. |
| 2026-04-08 | `nalexible-stone.html` | Reduced `.section` padding desktop 118px→68px→**46px**, mobile 82px→52px→**34px**; hero bottom 56px→**32px**; `footer margin-top` 92px→48px. |
| 2026-04-08 | `nalexible-fiberboard.html` | Reduced `.section` padding desktop 118px→68px→**46px**, mobile 82px→52px→**34px**; hero bottom 54px→**32px**; `footer margin-top` 92px→48px. |
| 2026-04-08 | `about.html` | Reduced `.section` padding desktop 112px→68px→**46px**, mobile 82px→52px→**34px**; hero bottom 56px→**32px**; `footer margin-top` 92px→48px. |
| 2026-04-08 | `catalog.html` | Reduced `.page-header` top padding 160px→96px; `.catalog-section` bottom padding 64px→44px. |

## Content Fixes

### nalexible-stone.html — Finish Highlights captions (2026-04-07)

Visual audit of the four Finish Highlights cards revealed that two cards had captions inconsistent with the actual image displayed. Images were correct and kept; only captions and i18n text were updated.

| Card | Image file | Before | After | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `nalexible/upload/product/1740453884.jpg` | Cement Series · **Silver Grey** | Cement Series · **Rose Pink** | Image is a warm pink/rose cement stone — not grey |
| 2 | `nalexible/upload/product/1740452475.jpg` | **Marble Series** · **White Crystal** | **Slate Series** · **Silver Grey** | Image is a cool-toned silver-grey slate with diagonal grain — not white, not marble |
| 3 | `nalexible/upload/product/1740452700.jpg` | Warm Vein · Golden Brown | unchanged | Image matches description |
| 4 | `nalexible/upload/product/nal-uv-black.jpg` | UV Series · Black | unchanged | Acceptable (UV Series is the product series name) |

Both EN and ZH i18n dictionary entries updated to match.

### catalog.html — Stone swatches (2026-04-07)

Full visual audit of all stone swatches across Flexible Stone, LumiSlate, EasyStone, UV Series, and 3D Wall Panel sections. All images match their product names (official Nalexible names: Arctic Storm, Indian Autumn, Zebra Black, Silver Gray, etc.). **No changes required.**

## Image Duplicate Audit (2026-04-06)

Full audit of all 140 HTML-referenced images. Reference: `_duplicates.html`

| # | Type | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| A | EXACT | `nal-res-door-white-panel.jpg` — same file at two paths (projects.html + catalog.html) | ✅ Fixed 2026-04-06 — catalog.html updated to `images/fiberboard/nal-res-door-white-panel.jpg` |
| B | EXACT | `nal-easy-indian-autumn-rustic.jpg` = `nal-uv-indian-autumn-rustic.jpg` — Easy/UV variants share identical photo | ⏳ Intentional pattern (same stone, different product line) — no change until a proper UV-specific swatch photo is available |
| C | d=0 | `fb-commercial-partitions.jpg` (841px, index.html) vs `fb-partition-commercial.jpg` (1200px, catalog.html) | ⏳ Fiberboard — deferred pending high-quality replacement image |
| D | d=0 | `fb-door-cutaway.jpg` (34KB) vs `fb-res-sliding-door.jpg` (70KB) — same image, two names | ⏳ Fiberboard — on-page duplicate partially resolved (fiberboard page app4 → `fb-joinery-builtin.jpg`). Remaining cross-page use deferred pending high-quality replacement image |
| E | d=0 | `fb-door-minimalist.jpg` / `fb-door-residential.jpg` / `fb-interior-wall-natural.jpg` — 3 names, 1 image | ⏳ Fiberboard — `fb-interior-wall-natural.jpg` resolved (replaced with brochure-p008-i031). `fb-door-residential.jpg` still duplicates `fb-door-minimalist.jpg` — deferred pending high-quality replacement image |
